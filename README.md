# Master-Class

> JavaScript classes with an edge.


This is library provides a [class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) [factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_%28object-oriented_programming%29). The instances of its generated classes have [many features](#Features) that will eventually allow them to:

- Be distributively managed between machines
- Be differently viewed in different contexts (e.g., depending on the viewer or an internal state)
- Be efficiently stored
- Keep precise track of their changes

 All while still feeling like plain JavaScript objects.
